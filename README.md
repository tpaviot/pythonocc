pythonOCC
=========

#### Get ready for agile CAD development ####

pythonOCC is a 3D CAD/CAE/PLM development framework for the Python programming language. It provides features such as advanced topological and geometrical operations, data exchange (STEP, IGES, STL import/export), 2D and 3D meshing, rigid body simulation, parametric modeling, GUI management support (wxPython, PyQt, python-xlib).

pythonOCC is built upon free and open source [OCE project](https://https://github.com/tpaviot/oce/), [GEOM](http://sf.net/projects/salomegeometry) for parametric modeling and [SMESH](http://sf.net/projects/salomesmesh) for advanced meshing features.

Some high level packages (parametric modeling, rigid body simulation, knowledge-based engineering, topology, data exchange, webservices, etc.), relying on industrial quality proven libraries (sympy for instance), extend the builtin features of those libraries to enable highly dynamic and modular programming in the engineering field.
